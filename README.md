# Twitter-Clone

## A twitter clone built with technologies like `ReactJs`, `material ui`, `css` and `firebase`.

Material ui was used for all the icons..
Real time firestore database was used for the comments and posts made
Css variable for twitter color and background color.
React-Flip-move for animations when posting tweets giving dynamic feeling to the site.

Then it was deployed using firebase.
